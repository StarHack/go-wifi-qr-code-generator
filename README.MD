# go-wifi-qr-code-generator

This projects generates QR codes for provided WiFi credentials. Users may then use their camera app to connect to the network in an easy way.

A user types:

- Their WiFi name (SSID)
- WiFi password
- Type (one of: `WPA`, `WEP`, `nopass`)

The program afterwards generates a file called `wifi-qr.png` (and `wifi-qr-branded.png` if `logo.png` exists).
